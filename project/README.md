Chatbot
========================

# Setup

* Remember to `bundle install`!

## Usage

* Seed the database with `rake db:seed` if you want the chatbot to know some nonsense  
* To run, use either `rake run` or `ruby bin/run.rb`. Everything should work fine. Follow the help text, and you'll understand.

## Phase 6: Presentation

It's time to show off your creation to the world! Things you might want to do are:

* Prepare a demo video describing how a user would interact with your working project.
  * The video should:
    * Have an overview of your project. (2 minutes max)
* Prepare a presentation to follow your video. (3 minutes max)
  * Your presentation should:
    * Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
    * Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
    * Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
    * Present any code you would like to highlight.
* Write a blog post about the project and process.
